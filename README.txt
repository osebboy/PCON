PCON: PHP Containers Library
----------------------------
PCON is an open source lightweight and powerful library of containers for PHP 5.3+. It aims to ease 
the repeated workload developers face in day-to-day application development while keeping a very close 
edge in performance compared to regular PHP arrays. The library does not limit the developer, nor does
it stand on the way. All classes are designed to be flexible, extensible and around 1.5 K after comments 
and white space are removed. It follows proven concepts and models from other programming languages, 
especially C++.
