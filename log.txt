12/14
- Introduced PCON\Interfaces namespace
	- Pcon and ContainerInterface added - all containers implement either one
	- ContainerInterface includes 2 new methods
		- filter()
		- toArray()
	- MapInterface, SetInterface, ListInterface API enhanced
		
- A unified 'property' introduced. Now each container has the same property 'container'.
	NOTE: This would make it possible to adapt PCON to Traits with PHP 5.4.

- Removed: PCON\Maps\SplObjectMap, PCON\Sets\StringSet
	NOTE: PCON\Sequence\Vector will also be removed in v1.2. These will be replaced with better abstract types.
